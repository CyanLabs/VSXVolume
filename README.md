VSXVolume
=========

VSX Volume started of as a simple application to hijack the volume control keys (Vol Up, Vol Down, Mute) to control your Pioneer VSX AVR via telnet instead of the computer volume., it has now become much more with automated commands on startup and exit of the application (including logoff/shutdown and sleep/resume)

The program works on command line arguments so be sure to check the documentation here http://cyanlabs.net/applications/vsx-volume/
